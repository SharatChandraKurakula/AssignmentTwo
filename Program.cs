        Given a string paragraph and a string array of the banned words banned, return the most frequent word that is not banned. It is guaranteed there is at least one word that is not banned, and that the answer is unique.
        The words in paragraph are case-insensitive and the answer should be returned in lowercase.

        Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive, that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"), and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.

Starting at the beginning of s, write as many letters on the first line such that the total width does not exceed 100 pixels. Then, from where you stopped in s, continue writing as many letters as you can on the second line. Continue this process until you have written all of s.

         Question 8
        International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows:
        •	'a' maps to ".-",
        •	'b' maps to "-...",
        •	'c' maps to "-.-.", and so on.
        For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English alphabet is given below:
        [".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]
        Given an array of strings words where each word can be written as a concatenation of the Morse code of each letter.
            •	For example, "cab" can be written as "-.-..--...", which is the concatenation of "-.-.", ".-", and "-...". We will call such a concatenation the transformation of a word.
        Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.
 
        Example 1:

You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most t. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.
        Return the least time until you can reach the bottom right square (n - 1, n - 1) if you start at the top left square (0, 0).
